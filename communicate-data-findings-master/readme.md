# PISA Dataset Visual Exploration
## by Isaac Paulson


## Dataset

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

## Summary of Findings

Shanghai, Singapore, and Hong Kong scored at or near the top in all subejct areas. Peru scored lowest (of countries assessed) in all categories. Females scored higher than males in reading in all countries.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Like males, females who score higher in one subject area tend to score higher in other subject areas as well. In general, females do not score high in reading and low in math and science. Exploration of other variables will be necessary to understand this trend further.
